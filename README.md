# HemeraMountJubilee

This Hemera Mount uses the e3d tool plate, and will mount on the Jubilee with a ~5mm spacer.

- Reuses the compression flexures from jubilee
- Has mounting holes for the dumbboard on top, or use the actual hemera-mount holes
- Includes features for auto tool-grab finding as well as tool presense sensing

I've included 2 more ducts that convert the e3d small fan ducts over to 5015 fans - I will be working on a supervolcano variant soon.

Hit me up if you experience issues or have suggestions.
